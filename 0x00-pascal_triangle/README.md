Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical construct named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although its study dates back to ancient China and Persia. It is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The first few rows of Pascal's Triangle look like this:

       1 1
      1 2 1
     1 3 3 1
    1 4 6 4 1
   1 5 10 10 5 1
  1 6 15 20 15 6 1
 1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1

Each number in the triangle is obtained by adding the two numbers directly above it. The outer edges of the triangle are always 1, and the interior numbers are the sum of the two numbers above them. The triangle has many interesting properties and applications in combinatorics and probability theory.
